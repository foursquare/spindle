## NOTICE - This project has moved.

It is now part of Foursquare's open source monorepo [Fsq.io](https://github.com/foursquare/fsqio) and all
future work will be published there.

The project very much lives on but this Github repo is deprecated.


# Spindle

Spindle is a Scala code generator for Thrift.
The complete documentation lives [here](http://spindle.readthedocs.org/en/v1.8/).

## Installation

Because Spindle is a code generator, it needs to plug into your build system.

If you're using sbt 0.12, you can use Spindle's thrift-codegen-plugin. In your project/plugins.sbt,
add the following line:

    addSbtPlugin("com.foursquare" % "spindle-codegen-plugin" % "1.8.3")

Then, in the build.sbt for the project with the *.thrift files to compile, add the following line:

    seq(thriftSettings: _*)

By default, the plugin will compile all *.thrift sources in src/main/thrift, though this is
configurable.

Keep in mind that this will add a few library dependencies to your project. Currently, this
includes spindle-runtime, apache thrift, joda-time, jackson, rogue-field, finagle-thrift, and
scalaj-collection. If you need a specific version of any of these dependencies, the plugin can be
configured to use those.
