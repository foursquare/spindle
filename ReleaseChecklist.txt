[** A note about version numbers:

    When choosing version numbers, we should follow the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Specification
    
    From http://semver.org/

        SUMMARY:

        Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

        MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
        MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
        PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
        Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

    In general, the "master" branch (that is, most new development) should have a MINOR version
    increment from the previous released version. Only if incompatible changes are planned should
    a MAJOR version increment be necessary. PATCH version increments should only be released for
    bugfixes specifically backported to a previous MINOR version release.
